1
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:04,157
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:07,393
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,413
I do hope
that Mr. Wick

4
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,282
finds his way to safety.

5
00:03:02,382 --> 00:03:04,417
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

6
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,686
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

7
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,988
Do you expect him
to make it out?

8
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,657
$14 million bounty
on his head.

9
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,427
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

10
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,363
I'd say the odds
are about even.

11
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,617
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

12
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,818
No way!

13
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:41,921
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

14
00:03:42,021 --> 00:03:43,923
But I know better, man.

15
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:45,892
I know better.
I know what I'm...

16
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,168
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

17
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,903
Tick tock.

18
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,938
Tick tock.

19
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:02,242
Tick tock. Tick...

20
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:04,711
No time to dilly-dally,
Mr. Wick!

21
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:21,127
The New York Public Library.

22
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:22,462
You got it.

23
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,283
Change of plan.

24
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:47,387
To the Continental.

25
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,490
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

26
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,059
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

27
00:04:54,327 --> 00:04:57,830
Good dog. Good dog.

28
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,542
John Wick, Excommunicado.

29
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,878
In effect, 20 minutes.

30
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:33,466
Can I help you?

31
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:36,736
Russian Folktale.
Alexander Afanasyev.

32
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:41,007
1864.

33
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,752
Level two.
Thank you.

34
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,876
"Consider your origins."

35
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,812
"You were not made
to live as brutes,"

36
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,515
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge."

37
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,952
Dante.

38
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:04,424
Looking a little
run down there, John.

39
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,059
Ernest. I still have time.

40
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,563
It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

41
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,698
You sure this is what
you wanna do?

42
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,567
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

43
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,968
Not if you can't spend it.

44
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,140
Oh, shit.

45
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,560
Push it back.

46
00:09:02,842 --> 00:09:04,477
John Wick, Excommunicado.

47
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,946
In effect, 10 minutes.

48
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:21,260
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

49
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,064
No help,
no services of any kind.

50
00:09:36,309 --> 00:09:39,812
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

51
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,248
Mr. Wick.

52
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,784
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

53
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,586
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

54
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,187
No! I can't.

55
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,989
I still have five minutes!

56
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,658
Please.

57
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,366
Come on. Come on.

58
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:08,240
All right, sit there.

59
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,214
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

60
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,216
Uh-huh.

61
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,786
Puncture wound.

62
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,156
Went deep.
Nicked the artery.

63
00:10:25,992 --> 00:10:27,727
Here you go.

64
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:30,062
All right.

65
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:35,568
John Wick, Excommunicado.

66
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,870
In effect, one minute.

67
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:52,051
Doc?

68
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:57,556
Doc?

69
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,659
Yeah. We're halfway there.

70
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,729
Five seconds.
Yeah.

71
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:06,232
John Wick, Excommunicado.

72
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,870
In effect, in five, four...

73
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,739
Three, two...

74
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:15,775
One.

75
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:26,519
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

76
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,220
I know. Rules.

77
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,189
Ah, rules.

78
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:37,897
John Wick, 14 million.

79
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:40,332
Open contract
is now in effect.

80
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,968
All services are suspended.

81
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,401
And away we go.

82
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,495
Top shelf. On the right.

83
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,730
Yeah. Take four.

84
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:47,900
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

85
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:58,911
Mr. Wick?

86
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,882
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

87
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,316
But you did.

88
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:05,718
They'll know.

89
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:06,986
Know what?

90
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,455
I told you
where the medicine was.

91
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,973
Where?
Here.

92
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:29,141
Just below my floating rib.

93
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:30,810
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

94
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,980
Oh, wait!

95
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,149
One may not be enough.

96
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,088
Yeah. All right.

97
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,658
Be sure not to graze my...

98
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,160
Oh!

99
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:57,036
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

100
00:13:59,638 --> 00:14:01,373
Thanks, Doc.

101
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,386
John Wick. Open contract.

102
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,089
Increase, 15 million.

103
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,960
Where are you going,
Jonathan?

104
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,638
We are closed.

105
00:25:56,354 --> 00:26:01,159
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

106
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:09,067
You present this to me
like an answer.

107
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,570
I still have my ticket.

108
00:26:12,837 --> 00:26:15,774
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

109
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:18,243
you think
your ticket is valid?

110
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,378
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

111
00:26:20,478 --> 00:26:22,347
is bound by the High Table,

112
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:25,650
and the High Table
stands above all?

113
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,119
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

114
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:34,793
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

115
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:40,832
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

116
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,952
You are bound...

117
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:03,622
And I am owed.

118
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,761
Rooney, enough!

119
00:27:40,892 --> 00:27:43,828
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

120
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:46,197
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

121
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,732
they wish for one thing.

122
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,168
A life free of suffering.

123
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,171
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

124
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,340
but as you know,

125
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:57,809
art is pain.

126
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,214
Life is suffering.

127
00:28:07,986 --> 00:28:10,455
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

128
00:28:11,322 --> 00:28:13,892
But here you are,
back where you began.

129
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:16,761
All of this, for what?

130
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:54,866
Pirouette.

131
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:59,037
Pirouette, pirouette.

132
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,208
Sit.

133
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:21,760
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

134
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,996
The High Table
wants your life.

135
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,233
How can you fight the wind?

136
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,001
How can you smash
the mountains?

137
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,604
How can you bury the ocean?

138
00:29:32,704 --> 00:29:35,140
How can you escape
from the light?

139
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,909
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

140
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,245
But they're in the dark, too.

141
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:47,886
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

142
00:29:50,388 --> 00:29:51,790
Passage.

143
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,459
Where did you want to go?

144
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,263
Casablanca.

145
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:03,201
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

146
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,841
So be it.

147
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:13,945
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

148
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:17,215
If that's what
you really desire.

149
00:30:56,387 --> 00:31:00,191
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

150
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,936
You can never come home again.

151
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,473
Take him to the lifeboat.

152
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:18,376
Do svidanya.

153
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,147
Do svidanya.

154
00:31:53,611 --> 00:31:57,148
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

155
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:20,204
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

156
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,174
Very well, sir.

157
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,346
The manager is in the lounge.

158
00:32:32,817 --> 00:32:36,854
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

159
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,290
If that's so,
we can make this short.

160
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,961
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

161
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,629
And that's the all of it.

162
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,831
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

163
00:32:46,931 --> 00:32:49,100
Oh, yes.

164
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,436
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

165
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:52,603
You're mistaken.

166
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:54,339
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

167
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,975
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

168
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,343
Hmm.
The blood was spilt

169
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,812
on the grounds of
the Continental. Was it not?

170
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:01,879
Oh, yes.

171
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,182
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

172
00:33:04,282 --> 00:33:06,150
within these very walls.

173
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,653
I'd like to see it.

174
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,217
Santino D'Antonio.

175
00:33:39,317 --> 00:33:41,552
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

176
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:42,520
slain by Mr. Wick

177
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:45,656
while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

178
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:53,197
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

179
00:33:53,297 --> 00:33:56,200
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

180
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,370
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

181
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:01,039
Yes.

182
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,207
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

183
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,743
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

184
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:08,980
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

185
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,681
you stood by
and let him walk away

186
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,251
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

187
00:34:13,351 --> 00:34:15,319
I made him Excommunicado.

188
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,256
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

189
00:34:18,356 --> 00:34:20,024
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

190
00:34:20,124 --> 00:34:22,627
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

191
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,996
Where is your fealty?

192
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:27,165
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

193
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:29,367
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

194
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:31,135
Everything is under the Table.

195
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,904
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

196
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:34,272
but this cannot be overlooked.

197
00:34:34,372 --> 00:34:37,708
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

198
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,744
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

199
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:42,280
Excuse me?

200
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,416
At such time,
your successor will be named.

201
00:34:47,018 --> 00:34:48,453
There are rules,

202
00:34:48,553 --> 00:34:50,188
they are the only things
that separate us...

203
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:52,757
From the animals.
Yes.

204
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:54,725
You have seven days.

205
00:34:58,062 --> 00:35:01,466
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

206
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:04,335
you may look for me
in room 217.

207
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,638
Enjoy your stay
at the Continental.

208
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:23,321
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

209
00:35:37,068 --> 00:35:40,271
Welcome to my Mission Control.

210
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:43,641
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

211
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:46,110
From whence I control
the word on the street,

212
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:47,478
the way of the world.

213
00:35:47,578 --> 00:35:48,613
With pigeons.

214
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:52,884
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

215
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,755
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

216
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:01,792
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

217
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:04,362
Can you get disease from it?

218
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:07,165
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

219
00:36:07,932 --> 00:36:10,001
What the hell do you want?

220
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:11,969
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

221
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:13,538
Where what didn't happen?

222
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,673
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

223
00:36:16,541 --> 00:36:17,575
I've always been
under the impression

224
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,912
that contracts and executing
them was optional.

225
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,247
I have no problem
with John Wick.

226
00:36:29,253 --> 00:36:32,557
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

227
00:36:32,657 --> 00:36:34,292
knowing that
he intended to use it

228
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,460
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

229
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,668
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

230
00:36:51,008 --> 00:36:52,543
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

231
00:36:52,643 --> 00:36:55,313
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

232
00:36:55,413 --> 00:36:57,882
Seven days for what, exactly?

233
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,116
To settle your affairs

234
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,452
and find a new home
for your birds.

235
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,355
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

236
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,602
Oh, my dear.

237
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,338
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

238
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,840
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

239
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:26,444
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

240
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:29,080
Because I am the throne, baby.

241
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,515
I am the Bowery!

242
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,619
I am all that you deign
not to look at

243
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:36,220
when you walk
down the street at night.

244
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,458
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

245
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:42,760
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

246
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:46,330
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

247
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,499
You have seven days.

248
00:39:28,265 --> 00:39:29,867
Enough!

249
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,175
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

250
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:40,878
But he's Excommunicado.

251
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,981
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

252
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,584
Mr. Jonathan,

253
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:49,754
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

254
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,643
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

255
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,912
Thanks.

256
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,785
Mr. Jonathan,

257
00:40:20,885 --> 00:40:22,653
it has been a long time
since our fine city

258
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,789
has been graced
with your presence.

259
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,390
I need to talk to...

260
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,526
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

261
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:39,403
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan Continental.

262
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:41,572
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

263
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,475
Right this way.

264
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:47,678
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

265
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:56,454
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

266
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,623
You a dog person, John?

267
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:34,892
Sofia?

268
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,899
Sofia!

269
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,568
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

270
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,905
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

271
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:50,107
Nice suit.

272
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:53,978
Good to see you, too.

273
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:56,747
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

274
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:58,182
I know.

275
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,589
Don't you do it.

276
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:08,993
You're Excommunicado, John.

277
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:13,998
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

278
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,071
This is your blood.

279
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,941
Your bond.

280
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:29,079
When you needed help,
I was there.

281
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,088
Sit.

282
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,628
I was talking to you, John.

283
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:53,370
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

284
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:55,139
I'm not service anymore, John.

285
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:58,909
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

286
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:01,512
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

287
00:43:01,612 --> 00:43:03,881
I just need you
to get me to him.

288
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,850
To who?
Your old boss.

289
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,020
You want to kill Berrada.

290
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,089
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

291
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,992
What could he
possibly give to you?

292
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:18,829
Guidance.

293
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:23,667
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

294
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:24,902
And that deal said

295
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:27,771
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

296
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,008
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

297
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,745
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

298
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,816
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

299
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:43,687
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

300
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:48,125
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

301
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:53,731
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

302
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,035
Do you wanna know
where she is?

303
00:43:58,702 --> 00:44:01,739
No. I don't ever wanna know.

304
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,908
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

305
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,947
A part of me longs for her.

306
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,184
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

307
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,986
just to keep her safe.

308
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:25,529
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

309
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,766
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

310
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:30,734
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

311
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:33,203
and that's why I'm fucked!

312
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,911
Consequences.
Yeah.

313
00:44:42,646 --> 00:44:44,748
Consequences.

314
00:44:46,617 --> 00:44:48,919
I'm just asking you to try.

315
00:44:49,753 --> 00:44:51,455
Either way, you and me,

316
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,791
we'll be even.

317
00:45:04,635 --> 00:45:06,103
No.

318
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:12,976
After this,
we are less than even.

319
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:18,849
We leave in 10 minutes.

320
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,040
How can I help you?

321
00:46:29,186 --> 00:46:31,889
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

322
00:46:34,057 --> 00:46:35,993
There is a task.

323
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,328
It involves someone
who broke the rules

324
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:39,797
and stood against the Table.

325
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:43,667
John Wick, you mean.

326
00:46:43,767 --> 00:46:45,636
My students
have not been idle.

327
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:48,906
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

328
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:51,008
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

329
00:46:51,108 --> 00:46:53,744
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

330
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,346
A dog, a car.

331
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:58,415
I'm familiar.

332
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,420
And I'm interested.

333
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,023
Very.

334
00:47:12,462 --> 00:47:15,432
Blowfish. Very fatal.

335
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:21,438
No soy.

336
00:47:29,913 --> 00:47:33,617
I have served,
I will be of service.

337
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:16,420
Stop!

338
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,227
Out!

339
00:49:30,534 --> 00:49:33,937
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

340
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:37,007
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

341
00:49:37,107 --> 00:49:38,075
He had a ticket.

342
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,811
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

343
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,981
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

344
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,515
Now...

345
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:52,990
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

346
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:06,470
I have served,
I will be of service.

347
00:50:29,092 --> 00:50:31,294
We're not going in
like the old days.

348
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:34,364
It's just a conversation.

349
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:38,568
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

350
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,774
Let's go.

351
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,666
Sofia.

352
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,269
Always so nice to see you.

353
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:16,339
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

354
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,141
Certainly.

355
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,448
Fantastic.

356
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,517
Jonathan Wick.

357
00:51:27,617 --> 00:51:31,088
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

358
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,295
Come along now.

359
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,564
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

360
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:49,573
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

361
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:52,142
Tell me.

362
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:54,377
Do you come here to kill me?

363
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,747
No.

364
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:11,361
Mr. Wick, do you know where the
word "assassin" comes from?

365
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:16,399
People argue. "Assassin."

366
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:21,538
Hashasheen,
followers of Hassan-i...

367
00:52:22,606 --> 00:52:25,609
Eaters of hashish.

368
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:28,478
No, thank you.

369
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:33,083
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

370
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:35,519
Meaning, "men who are faithful"

371
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,654
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

372
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:41,591
You see that coin?

373
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:45,262
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

374
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,632
Next to it, the first marker.

375
00:52:48,732 --> 00:52:51,334
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

376
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:52,669
Now, this coin, of course,

377
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:56,006
it does not represent
monetary value.

378
00:52:56,106 --> 00:52:59,142
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

379
00:52:59,242 --> 00:53:02,712
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

380
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,582
Order and rules.

381
00:53:06,383 --> 00:53:08,285
You have broken the rules.

382
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,388
The High Table
has marked you for death.

383
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,423
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

384
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:17,727
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

385
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:24,734
I seek to make amends.

386
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:27,637
To pay for what I've done.

387
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:31,675
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

388
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:39,649
This dog,
I do so love it.

389
00:53:39,749 --> 00:53:42,886
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

390
00:53:45,755 --> 00:53:47,591
Occasionally.

391
00:53:47,691 --> 00:53:51,027
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

392
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,429
And if he wants me dead...

393
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:56,233
Then he will see to it that your
bones bleach under the sun.

394
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,535
I see.

395
00:53:58,635 --> 00:54:00,971
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

396
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:09,646
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

397
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:13,583
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

398
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,221
You fail to understand.

399
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,257
The Elder
is not a man you find.

400
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:22,792
He can only choose
to find you.

401
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:24,628
You wish to speak with him?

402
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:28,098
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

403
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:29,599
Canis Minor,

404
00:54:29,699 --> 00:54:33,103
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

405
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,138
You follow the brightest star.

406
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:37,774
Walk until
you are almost dead.

407
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,310
Then, keep walking.

408
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:42,379
When you are
on your last breath,

409
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:46,683
he will find you...
Or he will not.

410
00:54:48,351 --> 00:54:50,020
I am grateful.

411
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,024
Thank you, sir.

412
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:59,562
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

413
00:55:02,832 --> 00:55:04,768
The social contract.

414
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:07,671
The commerce of relationships.

415
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:10,974
You have received
a great gift.

416
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,575
I have hosted your friend.

417
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,545
What do you offer in return?

418
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:22,452
So soft and yet so fierce.

419
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,555
I love it, this dog.

420
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:28,124
I will keep it.

421
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,359
Excuse me?

422
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:31,161
This will be my gift.

423
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,863
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

424
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,131
No.

425
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,400
Surely it's the least
you can do.

426
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,669
No, you cannot keep my dog.

427
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:42,105
Very well.

428
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:44,741
Very well.

429
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,311
Then I will kill it.

430
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,352
I'm sorry, Sofia.

431
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,754
This was for you to learn.

432
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:07,564
Don't.

433
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,408
Sofia. Don't.

434
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,081
He shot my dog.

435
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:00,884
I get it.

436
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,522
We gotta go. Now.

437
01:03:40,883 --> 01:03:42,451
Here you go.

438
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,625
You're gonna die, John.

439
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:52,728
Whether out here
in this desert,

440
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,498
or somewhere else
down the road.

441
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,101
But you are gonna die.

442
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:16,185
Consequences.

443
01:04:19,889 --> 01:04:21,490
Consequences.

444
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,086
Better get going.

445
01:04:59,295 --> 01:05:00,563
Sofia.

446
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:43,559
Okay.

447
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:50,466
You made your point.

448
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:53,736
You have earned my fealty.

449
01:07:54,837 --> 01:07:56,005
Matter of fact...

450
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,640
I'm gonna shove so much
fealty up your ass

451
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:59,742
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

452
01:07:59,842 --> 01:08:01,911
You had your chance.

453
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:04,980
Well, since you see it
that way,

454
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:06,916
I guess it's time I told you

455
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:11,153
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

456
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,155
Duly noted.

457
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:14,890
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

458
01:08:14,990 --> 01:08:18,561
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

459
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:21,630
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

460
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:27,736
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

461
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:31,507
The king is dead.

462
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:38,380
Long live the king.

463
01:09:32,134 --> 01:09:33,536
Drink.

464
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:39,308
Don't worry, your weapon
is still there. Please drink.

465
01:09:49,418 --> 01:09:53,556
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

466
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:55,191
Not lost.

467
01:09:56,058 --> 01:09:57,393
Looking for you.

468
01:09:57,493 --> 01:10:00,296
You think
I speak of your location?

469
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:03,399
Never seen a man fight so hard

470
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,734
to end up
back where he started.

471
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:15,311
So tell me, Jonathan.

472
01:10:15,411 --> 01:10:17,580
Why do you wish to live?

473
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:21,584
My wife, Helen.

474
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:28,657
To remember her.
To remember us.

475
01:10:28,757 --> 01:10:31,760
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

476
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,631
At least a chance to earn it.

477
01:10:36,932 --> 01:10:41,303
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

478
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,639
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

479
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:46,809
Complete a task for us,

480
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,144
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

481
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,313
The open contract closed,

482
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,382
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

483
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:56,485
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

484
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:59,855
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

485
01:11:04,059 --> 01:11:05,728
The choice is yours.

486
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:09,765
Die here and now.

487
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:13,035
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

488
01:11:30,319 --> 01:11:32,288
What must be done?

489
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,324
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

490
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:38,427
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

491
01:11:39,328 --> 01:11:40,362
What?

492
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,931
He has forgotten his fealty.

493
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,601
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

494
01:11:45,701 --> 01:11:48,570
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

495
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:50,906
So if you wish to live,

496
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,676
and if you wish to remember,

497
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:55,811
this is the choice
you must make.

498
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,730
I will serve.

499
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,735
I will be of service.

500
01:12:19,835 --> 01:12:21,904
Very well, my son.

501
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,706
Cast aside your weakness

502
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:26,875
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

503
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,483
Mr. John Wick.

504
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:23,665
Thank you.

505
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,804
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

506
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:48,724
I wish you good luck
on your path.

507
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,827
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

508
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,763
And Mr. Wick.

509
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:37,406
JFK Express
now arriving on platform nine.

510
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,709
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

511
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:04,793
Stick together, kids.

512
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:06,061
Make sure
you're holding the hand

513
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:09,631
of the person
in front and behind you.

514
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,103
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

515
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,108
I wouldn't have stopped.

516
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,111
It's good to have you back.

517
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:31,920
How was your trip?

518
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:36,658
Going to the Continental?

519
01:16:42,531 --> 01:16:44,299
He with you?

520
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:46,802
He was.

521
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,313
Nice trick.

522
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,870
Sir! Put your weapon down.

523
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,774
He's Excommunicado.

524
01:20:12,874 --> 01:20:15,343
Unless you wish
to become the same,

525
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:19,481
I suggest you lower your gun.

526
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,823
I'd like to see the manager.

527
01:20:30,192 --> 01:20:32,027
Of course.

528
01:20:32,127 --> 01:20:35,030
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

529
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:49,311
Please take a seat.

530
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,047
I will let him know
you have arrived.

531
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:28,016
I gotta tell you,

532
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:31,086
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

533
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:34,489
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

534
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,895
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

535
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,300
Is that the dog?

536
01:21:45,400 --> 01:21:47,335
He likes you.

537
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:52,040
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

538
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,175
Hey, dog.

539
01:21:56,778 --> 01:22:01,082
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

540
01:22:01,182 --> 01:22:03,451
We're not the same.

541
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:05,120
Yes, we are.

542
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,290
No, we're not.

543
01:22:08,390 --> 01:22:10,859
The manager
is ready for you now.

544
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:12,928
In the administrative lounge,
sir.

545
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:28,743
Mr. Wick.

546
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,180
Sit.

547
01:22:33,481 --> 01:22:34,950
Stay.

548
01:22:36,284 --> 01:22:37,352
Good dog.

549
01:23:33,308 --> 01:23:35,777
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

550
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:47,489
We only use this room
on special occasions.

551
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:51,726
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

552
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,428
under the table.

553
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:57,565
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

554
01:23:58,666 --> 01:23:59,834
Yeah.

555
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:01,770
Well, of course.

556
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:06,574
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

557
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,444
Isn't that why you're here?

558
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:14,449
I have served,
I will be of service.

559
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,953
But you're having doubts.

560
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:22,991
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

561
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,260
If you feel you must,

562
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:29,798
put a bullet through my heart.

563
01:24:36,237 --> 01:24:38,840
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

564
01:24:38,940 --> 01:24:40,475
The hour?

565
01:24:40,975 --> 01:24:42,077
The hour.

566
01:24:42,177 --> 01:24:44,679
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

567
01:24:45,847 --> 01:24:48,083
Maybe I should have.

568
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,785
Rules and consequences.

569
01:24:50,885 --> 01:24:52,220
Hmm.

570
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:53,588
It seems like everyone
is suffering

571
01:24:53,688 --> 01:24:56,191
from the consequences
of their actions.

572
01:24:56,291 --> 01:24:58,760
And you're not stepping down?

573
01:25:00,728 --> 01:25:02,297
No.

574
01:25:02,997 --> 01:25:04,899
I don't think I am.

575
01:25:04,999 --> 01:25:06,901
So it's war?

576
01:25:07,001 --> 01:25:09,370
You're going to war
with the High Table?

577
01:25:09,971 --> 01:25:11,172
Skirmish.

578
01:25:11,272 --> 01:25:12,307
Unless you decide to shoot me.

579
01:25:12,407 --> 01:25:16,444
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

580
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:19,314
than that of an enemy.

581
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:22,383
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

582
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,054
What choice?

583
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:28,723
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

584
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:33,128
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

585
01:25:33,228 --> 01:25:35,730
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

586
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:40,502
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

587
01:25:40,602 --> 01:25:43,771
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

588
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:48,343
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

589
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,245
The Baba Yaga?

590
01:25:50,345 --> 01:25:52,313
The last thing
many men ever see?

591
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:57,318
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

592
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,355
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

593
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:35,156
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

594
01:26:35,256 --> 01:26:37,192
I am an Adjudicator.

595
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,428
Have you decided to step down?

596
01:26:42,931 --> 01:26:45,533
I think not.

597
01:26:45,633 --> 01:26:48,870
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

598
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,543
No, I don't think I will.

599
01:27:03,117 --> 01:27:04,586
Very well.

600
01:27:12,794 --> 01:27:14,062
Administration.

601
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,564
I'd like to
change a designation.

602
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:18,299
Verification?

603
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,536
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

604
01:27:21,636 --> 01:27:23,571
The Continental Hotel,
New York.

605
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,707
New designation?

606
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,375
Deconsecrated.

607
01:27:30,011 --> 01:27:31,246
Processing.

608
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:34,749
Administrator.

609
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:40,388
File. The New York
Continental Hotel.

610
01:27:50,598 --> 01:27:55,336
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

611
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:04,712
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

612
01:28:04,812 --> 01:28:07,582
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

613
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:09,651
Since you are refusing
to step down

614
01:28:09,751 --> 01:28:14,322
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

615
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:16,457
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

616
01:28:16,557 --> 01:28:19,494
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

617
01:28:20,495 --> 01:28:22,697
Good evening, gentlemen.

618
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:29,971
This haven is safe no more.

619
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:35,576
Are services
still off limits to me?

620
01:28:36,244 --> 01:28:37,412
Under the circumstances,

621
01:28:37,512 --> 01:28:39,480
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

622
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,115
What do you need?

623
01:28:41,616 --> 01:28:44,986
Guns. Lots of guns.

624
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:05,440
Let's make a withdrawal.

625
01:29:29,263 --> 01:29:30,565
Remember, sir.

626
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,934
These will be
High Table forces.

627
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,837
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

628
01:29:36,304 --> 01:29:37,438
Why?

629
01:29:37,538 --> 01:29:39,507
Much has changed
during your time away.

630
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:41,175
Like what?

631
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:44,379
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

632
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:55,857
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

633
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,593
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

634
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:11,506
Attention, all guests.

635
01:30:11,606 --> 01:30:14,876
The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.

636
01:30:14,976 --> 01:30:16,711
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

637
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,046
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

638
01:30:23,684 --> 01:30:26,354
Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...

639
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:30,124
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

640
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:31,659
Your transaction
may now be conducted

641
01:30:31,759 --> 01:30:33,661
on Continental grounds.

642
01:30:39,066 --> 01:30:42,403
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

643
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:45,640
Cool. Very cool.

644
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:55,116
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

645
01:30:55,216 --> 01:30:57,118
Serious business.

646
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:01,789
Thank you.

647
01:31:01,889 --> 01:31:03,591
Let us begin.

648
01:32:49,664 --> 01:32:52,767
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

649
01:32:53,434 --> 01:32:55,169
Of course, sir.

650
01:33:16,157 --> 01:33:19,160
I know you'll do
the Continental proud.

651
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,928
I'll see you soon, sir.

652
01:33:23,698 --> 01:33:27,301
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

653
01:33:27,401 --> 01:33:28,736
What's that?

654
01:33:29,270 --> 01:33:30,871
Hunt.

655
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,555
Winston! Winston!

656
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:13,994
I need more firepower.

657
01:37:36,784 --> 01:37:38,686
Armor improvements.

658
01:37:38,786 --> 01:37:41,989
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

659
01:41:09,196 --> 01:41:11,465
Only by my sword, John.

660
01:41:23,444 --> 01:41:25,779
I know you
believe you can keep this up.

661
01:41:25,879 --> 01:41:27,014
But I assure you...

662
01:49:32,132 --> 01:49:35,068
John, you're incredible.

663
01:49:36,002 --> 01:49:37,103
Exhausted,

664
01:49:37,504 --> 01:49:39,272
outnumbered...

665
01:49:39,372 --> 01:49:40,907
Obviously in pain.

666
01:49:41,841 --> 01:49:44,511
And you still beat
all of my students.

667
01:49:44,611 --> 01:49:46,713
If I didn't
have to kill you,

668
01:49:47,213 --> 01:49:49,716
we'd be pals.

669
01:49:50,250 --> 01:49:51,851
Let's do this.

670
01:50:19,379 --> 01:50:22,115
See? We're the same.

671
01:54:08,741 --> 01:54:11,411
I would like to suggest
a parley.

672
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,146
A parley would be good.

673
01:54:13,246 --> 01:54:14,514
Very well.

674
01:54:25,625 --> 01:54:27,360
Are we in play, sir?

675
01:54:28,895 --> 01:54:30,363
Oh, very much so.

676
01:54:49,782 --> 01:54:51,517
Hey, John.

677
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:56,256
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

678
01:54:59,959 --> 01:55:01,361
Yeah.

679
01:55:30,790 --> 01:55:32,625
Yeah.

680
01:55:32,725 --> 01:55:36,129
Don't worry about me, John.

681
01:55:36,229 --> 01:55:38,531
I just gotta catch my breath.

682
01:55:40,233 --> 01:55:42,168
I'll catch up to you, John.

683
01:55:47,106 --> 01:55:49,275
No, you won't.

684
01:55:59,552 --> 01:56:00,753
You gentlemen, of course,

685
01:56:00,853 --> 01:56:02,989
realize that was
the first wave.

686
01:56:03,089 --> 01:56:05,425
Merely an amuse-bouche.

687
01:56:05,525 --> 01:56:07,160
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

688
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,962
but it only ends one way.

689
01:56:09,062 --> 01:56:11,431
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

690
01:56:11,531 --> 01:56:13,933
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

691
01:56:14,033 --> 01:56:15,168
Oh, you can take
the Continental,

692
01:56:15,268 --> 01:56:16,302
I have no doubt about that.

693
01:56:16,402 --> 01:56:18,638
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

694
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:22,308
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

695
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:24,711
We are High Table.

696
01:56:25,378 --> 01:56:26,612
And we

697
01:56:27,747 --> 01:56:29,515
are New York City.

698
01:56:30,383 --> 01:56:32,218
Are we negotiating?

699
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:35,355
Hmm.

700
01:56:35,888 --> 01:56:37,390
I believe we are.

701
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:44,230
Parley?

702
01:56:44,931 --> 01:56:46,399
Parley.

703
01:56:49,635 --> 01:56:52,138
What do you propose we do?

704
01:56:56,075 --> 01:56:58,277
Let me keep my power.

705
01:56:58,711 --> 01:57:00,013
Under the Table.

706
01:57:02,782 --> 01:57:04,217
I have served

707
01:57:04,317 --> 01:57:07,120
and been a beacon
of order and stability

708
01:57:07,220 --> 01:57:09,188
to our industry
for over 40 years.

709
01:57:09,288 --> 01:57:11,624
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

710
01:57:11,724 --> 01:57:15,028
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

711
01:57:17,397 --> 01:57:18,798
Winston.

712
01:57:24,337 --> 01:57:25,972
You were
merely showing strength

713
01:57:26,072 --> 01:57:28,674
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

714
01:57:32,178 --> 01:57:35,314
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

715
01:57:36,549 --> 01:57:38,051
But what about him?

716
01:57:39,986 --> 01:57:43,589
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

717
01:57:48,961 --> 01:57:50,730
Oh, he has to die.

718
01:57:52,131 --> 01:57:54,000
Sorry, Jonathan.
Winston!

719
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:55,268
Don't see any other way.

720
01:58:07,246 --> 01:58:08,981
Very well, gentlemen.

721
01:58:09,082 --> 01:58:12,485
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

722
01:58:13,286 --> 01:58:15,354
Good day to you both.

723
01:58:19,125 --> 01:58:21,094
Well played, sir.

724
01:58:56,195 --> 01:58:59,098
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

725
01:58:59,198 --> 01:59:01,134
Oh, should be no time at all.

726
01:59:04,937 --> 01:59:06,739
Mr. Wick is gone.

727
01:59:06,839 --> 01:59:08,674
A true tragedy.

728
01:59:08,774 --> 01:59:10,009
You misunderstand.

729
01:59:10,109 --> 01:59:12,979
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

730
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:14,147
That seems improbable.

731
01:59:14,247 --> 01:59:15,681
And yet, true.

732
01:59:17,183 --> 01:59:19,952
I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.

733
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:22,221
Both from above and below.

734
01:59:22,321 --> 01:59:23,756
The last thing
either one of us needs

735
01:59:23,856 --> 01:59:26,492
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

736
01:59:28,995 --> 01:59:31,097
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

737
01:59:31,197 --> 01:59:33,366
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

738
01:59:33,466 --> 01:59:37,436
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

739
01:59:49,048 --> 01:59:50,616
Baba Yaga.

740
02:00:03,062 --> 02:00:04,430
Mmm.

741
02:00:21,681 --> 02:00:24,116
How you doing, John?

742
02:00:24,217 --> 02:00:26,953
You look as bad as I feel.

743
02:00:28,854 --> 02:00:31,424
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

744
02:00:31,524 --> 02:00:33,993
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

745
02:00:36,529 --> 02:00:39,398
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

746
02:00:39,498 --> 02:00:42,301
Ain't that a bitch?

747
02:00:47,540 --> 02:00:51,410
Oh, John fucking Wick.

748
02:00:51,510 --> 02:00:54,113
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

749
02:00:54,213 --> 02:00:55,715
and you take the fall.

750
02:00:55,815 --> 02:00:56,882
Can't say I blame him.

751
02:00:56,983 --> 02:00:59,518
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

752
02:01:00,253 --> 02:01:03,022
But this High Table shit...

753
02:01:06,025 --> 02:01:07,827
Seven cuts.

754
02:01:11,197 --> 02:01:14,000
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

755
02:01:15,668 --> 02:01:18,571
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

756
02:01:18,671 --> 02:01:21,274
you better cut him
to the quick.

757
02:01:25,778 --> 02:01:27,280
So...

758
02:01:29,582 --> 02:01:31,584
Let me ask you, John.

759
02:01:32,051 --> 02:01:33,286
How do you feel?

760
02:01:35,588 --> 02:01:40,059
'Cause I am really pissed off.

761
02:01:40,860 --> 02:01:42,695
You pissed, John?

762
02:01:42,795 --> 02:01:43,996
Hmm?

763
02:01:44,096 --> 02:01:45,431
Are you?

764
02:01:55,074 --> 02:01:56,842
Yeah.
