00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.743
Over the next few months,

00:00:01.743 --> 00:00:04.320
Luis and I will be your primary instructors.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.445
I'm a former physicist,

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.464
former neuroscientist, and current huge fan of all things data.

00:00:09.464 --> 00:00:13.964
I've been working with Python and data in general for the past nine years.

00:00:13.964 --> 00:00:15.480
During my PhD work,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.505
I used machine learning models to classify electrical signals from neurons.

00:00:19.504 --> 00:00:22.704
I've also created a few Python data science libraries,

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:25.559
a Bayesian data analysis package called Sample,

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.792
and SQL, SQL for data analysts.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.530
I'm fascinated by deep learning because automation is

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:34.500
the future and deep learning is the future of automation.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.299
And I am a pure mathematician and a former Google engineer.

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:43.104
During my PhD, I worked in algebraic combinatorics,

00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:46.759
a field in which theoretical mathematics and applied probability meet.

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:51.144
I then spent some years in academia working on research and teaching at university.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.010
This is where I fell in love with machine learning and I

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:55.159
decided to switch to Google where I worked in

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:59.974
a team that uses machine learning algorithms to generate YouTube video recommendations.

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:02.535
I, too, find deep learning fascinating as it combines

00:01:02.534 --> 00:01:05.340
theoretical beauty with powerful applications.
