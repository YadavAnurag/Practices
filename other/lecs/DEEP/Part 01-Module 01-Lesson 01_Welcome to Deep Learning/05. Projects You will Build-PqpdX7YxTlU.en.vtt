00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
The most important part of your journey are the projects we've prepared for you.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.304
Through these projects, you'll get to apply what you learn in a unique hands-on way.

00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:10.808
These are the major milestones in your journey,

00:00:10.808 --> 00:00:13.439
really cool deep learning models you can show off to your friends and family.

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:16.460
And you're not just submitting projects into the ether.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.760
You'll get in-depth code review from Udacity's deep learning experts,

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.840
so you can iterate and truly master these concepts.

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:26.472
The first project, which you'll be able to start in just a few minutes,

00:00:26.472 --> 00:00:28.865
will have you building your first neural network.

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:30.809
You'll use it to predict daily bike rentals.

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:32.265
In the second project,

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.219
you'll build a model which detects if a dog is in a picture.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.924
And if there is, it predicts its breed.

00:00:37.924 --> 00:00:39.329
If there's a human in the picture,

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.079
it will tell you what breed of dog the human looks like the most.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.369
In the third project,

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:48.719
you'll use a recurrent neural network to generate new scripts for your favorite TV show.

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.119
So you can live in a world where Firefly was never canceled.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.365
In the fourth project,

00:00:53.365 --> 00:00:57.600
you'll use a generative adversarial network to create novel human faces.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.960
And finally, for the fifth project,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.429
you'll use deep reinforcement learning to automate flying drones.

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:07.250
Some of the content may be familiar if you've taken other Udacity courses.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.674
If you've seen it before, feel free to skip ahead,

00:01:09.674 --> 00:01:11.609
although we do recommend you to go over it to

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:14.489
refresh your memory and strengthen your understanding.

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:17.309
We have a large corpus of material to pull from and we like to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.000
utilize our most effective materials when teaching select concepts.
