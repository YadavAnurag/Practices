1. Ground level terms

1. Label - True answer
2. Input - predictor variable(s), what you can you to predict the label
3. Example - Input + coresspoding label(s)
4. Model - Mathematical function that take input and create approximation to label
5. Traning - Adjusting model to minimize the error
6. Prediction - Using model on unlabeled data



2. Classes of the ML Models-

1. Supervised(input with labels)-
    1. Regression - Prediction of value
    2. Classification - prediction of class
2. Unsupervised(unlabeled examples) - looking at the raw data, and seeing if it naturally falls into groups.
    1. Clustering - predictino of structure of data
    2. Anomaly Detection - any abnormal in data

3. 
1. Structured Data -  row and columnwise(sql data)
2. Unstructured Data - audio, video, sound, text

4. 
a. A neural n/w with no hidden layers is a linear model
b. Models on structured data are few layers deep but whereas image classification DNNs can have hundreds of layers.
